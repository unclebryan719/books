  <p class="ziti3">It's fair to say that MySQL is the most popular open source database.It has a very large installed base and number of users.Let's see what are the reasons MySQL is so popular,where it stands currently,and maybe touch on some of its future(although predicting the future is rarely successful).</p>

  <p class="ziti3">Looking at the customer area of MySQL,which includes Facebook,Flickr,Adobe(in Creative Suite 3),Drupal,Digg,LinkedIn,Wikipedia,eBay,YouTube,Google AdSense(source http://mysql.com/customers/and public resources),it's obvious that MySQL is everywhere.When you log in to your popular forum(powered by Bulleting)or blog(powered by WordPress),most likely it has MySQL as its backend database.Traditionally,two MySQL's characteristics,simplicity of use and performance,were what allowed it to gain such popularity.In addition to that,availability on a very wide range of platforms(including Windows)and built-in replication,which provides an easy scale-out solution for read-only clients,gave more user attractions and production deployments.There is simple evidence of MySQL's simplicity:In 15 minutes or less,you really can get installed,have a working database,and start running queries and store data.From its early stages MySQL had a good interface to most popular languages for Web development-PHP and Perl,and also Java and ODBC connectors.</p>

  <p class="ziti3">There are two best known storage engines in MySQL:MyISAM and InnoDB(I don't cover NDB cluster here;it's a totally different story).MyISAM comes as the default storage engine and historically it is the oldest,but InnoDB is ACID compliant and provides transactions,row-level locking,MVCC,automatic recovery and data corruption detection.This makes it the storage engine you want to choose for your application.Also,there is the third-party transaction storage engine PBXT,with characteristics similar to InnoDB,which is included in the MariaDB distribution.</p>

  <p class="ziti3">MySQL's simplicity has its own drawback.Just as it is very easy to start working with it,it is very easy to start getting into trouble with it.As soon as your website or forum gets popular,you may figure out that the database is a bottleneck,and that you need special skills and tools to fix it.</p>

  <p class="ziti3">The author of this book is a MySQL expert,especially in InnoDB storage engineB.Hence,I highly recommend this book to new users of InnoDB as well as uers who already have well-tuned InnoDB-based applications but need to get internal out of them.</p>
